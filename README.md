# DynastyRanker.com

DynastyRanker is a website that I've been working on since October 2020. It scrapes the trade values of Dynasty Fantasy Football players
from KeepTradeCut.com and ranks the teams in the user's fantasy football leagues based on total trade capital.

Dynasty Fantasy Football is fantasy football with the twist that you no longer reset at the end of the year and you keep your team forever. This
style of fantasy football is relatively new but has a large community and constantly has people working on resources to help continue to grow the subgenre and I always
wanted to contribute in some way. I posted my site on the DynastyFF subreddit and expected 3 people to tell me it was cool and move on but to my surprise it ended up a top 5
post of the year and I've had over 15k unique visitors to the site since 4/6 when I launched it.

The users have made a bunch of requests of different features so I have my work cut out for me for the future.
